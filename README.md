## About my first project

### [➡️ Open the app ⬅️](https://chess-game-vanilla.netlify.app)


After learning the basics (HTML, CSS and JS), we started the bootcamp project together led by the  lecturer, we received a task, try it alone and then solved it together, this is how we built the game step by step.

<b>That was the moment I realized I enjoyed programming.</b>
